# The direct implementation of an inorder traversal using recusion has O(h) space complexity, where h is the hight of the tree. Recursion can be removed with an explicit stack, but the space complexity remains O(h)
#
# Write a nonrecursive program for performing inorder traversal on a binary tree. Assume nodes have parent fields.

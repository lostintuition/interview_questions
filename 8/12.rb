# Let L be a singly linked list. Assume its nodes are numbered starting at 0.
# Define the even-odd merge of L to be the list consisting of the even-numbered nodes follow by the odd-numbered nodes.
# The even-dd merge is illustrated in Figure 8.10
#
# Write a function that computes the even-odd merge
